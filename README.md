# Flowmap

this was a university project. I created a WebGIS to visualise the syrian migration flow due to the civil war (2011-2018).
The data is provided by EUROSTAT. Django was used as framework and PostgreSQL (PostGIS) as the database. I used https://github.com/jwasilgeo/Leaflet.Canvas-Flowmap-Layer#symbology as a base.
Charts.js was used to create the barchart on the topright of the map.
I could not manage to create a Legend in HTML so I used Leaflet Watermarks to import a *.png file.
Also the data is not very well structured.

Have a look at the Map:
